# Canopy Interception in Turfgrass Systems

**Name:** Wes Dyer<br/>
**Semester:** Spring 2020

## Objectives 
Write a python code to analyze turfgrass canopy interception datasets.

 

## Outcomes
Generate 3 to 4 figures depicting the effects of canopy interception in a turfgrass system and model those effects across various regions. Figures generated will look at the effects of rainfall intensity, duration and total amount of precipitation intercepted. The python code I will generate will need to identify important processes in the dataset, such as when a rainfall event begins and ends, when interception is taking place and when throughfall starts and ceases. 

## Rationale
Canopy interception is defined as rainfall which is intercepted by and evaporated from plant canopies or plant residue and is one of many processes that is involved in the water cycle. Models have been developed to describe interception, however interception in turfgrass systems have not been well defined. Interception in a turfgrass canopy occurs when precipitation is retained and redistributed to the soil (throughfall and stemflow), evaporated from the plant leaves and taken in by the plant. Interception in turfgrass can amount up to 20% of precipitation, which is a significant part of the soil/water balance. 

Part of my current research involves collecting interception data from the field and simulating interception in the greenhouse. My goal is to utilize python to analyze the datasets.
