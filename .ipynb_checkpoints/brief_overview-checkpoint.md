# Canopy Interception in Turfgrass Systems

**Name:** Wes Dyer<br/>
**Semester:** Spring 2020

## Objectives 
Write a python code to analyze turfgrass canopy interception datasets.

 

## Outcomes
Generate figures depicting the effects of canopy interception in a turfgrass system. Figures generated will look at the effects of rainfall intensity, duration and total amount of precipitation intercepted. The python code will need to identify important processes in the dataset, such as when a rainfall event begins and ends, when interception is taking place and detect the point of throughfall.  

## Rationale
Canopy interception is defined as rainfall which is intercepted by and evaporated from plant canopies or plant residue and is one of many processes that is involved in the water cycle. Models have been developed to describe interception, however interception in turfgrass systems has not been well defined. Interception in a turfgrass canopy occurs when precipitation is retained and redistributed to the soil (throughfall and stemflow), evaporated from the plant leaves and taken in by the plant.

Part of my current research involves collecting interception data. My goal is to utilize python to analyze the datasets.

Raindrops intercepted by turfgrass leaves that will not make into the soil surface and ultimately will be evaporated back into the atmosphere. 

## Results

Timeseries depiciting cumulative precipitation and throughfall.
