# Canopy Interception in Turfgrass Systems

## Rationale
Canopy interception is defined as rainfall which is intercepted by and evaporated from plant canopies or plant residue and is one of many processes that is involved in the soil water balance. Canopy interception can have a signicant role in reducing the amount of water that reaches the soil surface. Agricultural crops such as corn may intercept 20% to 30% of rainfall as it matures, interception values for a tallgrass praire can range from 25% upward to 60%, and a deciduous forest can intercept around 30% precipitation. Models have been developed to describe interception, however interception in turfgrass systems has not been well-defined. Interception in a turfgrass canopy occurs when precipitation is retained and redistributed to the soil (throughfall and stemflow) and evaporated from the plant leaves. Understanding the interception dynamics associated with turfgrass will allow one to make better irrigation decisions, particulary the amount of water to apply. Prelimary results have shown some turfgrass species can intercept 5 to 10 mm of rainfall.

When raindrops fall on turfgrass, water may flow through gaps in the canopy (throughfall), flow along stems to the soil surface (stemflow) or  evaporate from the surface of the canopy. The total amount of water intercepted from plant canopies can be defined as: <br/>
<br/>
 **Interception = Rainfall - (Throughfall + Stemflow)** <br/>

Measuring interception from plant canopies can pose some challenges. However, our setup to measure interception in turfgrass included paired rain gauges (TE525MM-L Campbell Sci.), one to measure precipitation and one to measure throughfall. To measure throughfall, circular turfgrass patches (zoysiagrass) were cut and placed to cover the entire diameter of the sensor. Data was collected in 1-minute rainfall records. In this notebook, we will examine how key componets such as duration, intensity and amount from a rainfall event influence canopy interception in a turfgrass.
